Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git creates a hidden metadata file that tracks commit histories and other functions of the program.  This must be done to use Git's functions.  Otherwise, what's the point?

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area functions like an artist's pallette (spelling?).  It groups files along the lines of a commit's logical boundaries.  I suspect it helps with resource stewardship and makes the log a bit more readable.  Regardless, it keeps the developer's focus on the files affected by a change.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: If you only add the files you need for a logical change, you can't possibly over-commit.  See what I did there?

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: Branches are another good way to subdivide logical changes.  If a project begins to fork off in different directions, a branch is a smart way for those paths to be seperate.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A: They solidify my understanding.  I had a fairly decent grasp of it beforehand, however.  This course is well done.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A: Two branches become one.  Changes (both additions and ommisions) are kept and a new master branch is formed. The diagram shows the history in a graphical version of the log.

Q: What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

A: The pros are obvious.  It is a well thought out automation that removes the burden of combing over lines of code to figure out what stays and what goes.  The cons are a lack of control at times, though it seems like Git handles the process pretty well.
